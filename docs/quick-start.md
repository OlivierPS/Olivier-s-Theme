# Quick start

This page is for users who *just want a good setup* without reading the entire manual.
In a few minutes, you can get a clean, comfortable configuration for both Light and Dark modes.

## 1. Install and enable the theme

1. In Obsidian, open **Settings → Appearance → Themes**.  
2. Browse community themes and search for **“Olivier’s Theme”**.  
3. Install it, then click **Use** to activate it.

## 2. Enable the Style Settings plugin

1. Open **Settings → Community plugins**.  
2. Make sure community plugins are allowed.  
3. Install and enable the **Style Settings** plugin.  
4. In the left sidebar, click **Style Settings**, then choose **Olivier’s Theme** in the list.

You are now ready to adjust the theme using its dedicated panel.

## 3. Choose your Light mode palette

In **Style Settings → Olivier’s Theme → LIGHT MODE colors**:

1. Open **General palette**.  
2. Pick a palette that matches your taste (for example *Beige*, *Icy*, *Paradiso*, etc.).
3. Leave all other Light mode color options on **Default** for now.

With this single choice, the theme sets coordinated accent colors, text colors, backgrounds and highlight color for Light mode — and also chooses a related Dark palette.

## 4. Check Dark mode

Switch Obsidian to **Dark mode** (Settings → Appearance → Theme → Dark).

In **Style Settings → DARK MODE colors**:

1. Make sure **General palette** is set to **Default \< light mode** if you want Light and Dark to be related.  
2. If you prefer a very different mood at night, choose an explicit Dark palette from the list (for example *LYT* or *Victorian*).

Again, you can leave the other Dark options on **Default**.

## 5. Adjust basic text sizes

In **Style Settings → GENERAL settings**:

- Set **Base size for interface text** to something comfortable.  
  A good starting point is **16 px**.

Then, in **READING mode**:

- **Body text size**: try **18 px** as a default.  
- **Line length**: keep the default around **40 em**.  
- **Line height**: around **1.45 em** works well for most fonts.

In **WRITING / EDITING mode**:

- **Body text size**: try **17 px** (slightly smaller than Reading).  
- **Line length**: around **46 em** for more context while writing.  
- **Line height**: around **1.35 em** for a slightly denser, “working” layout.

You can fine‑tune these later; the goal is simply to reach a comfortable baseline.

## 6. Pick your note background style

Still in **LIGHT MODE colors**:

- **Note background in Reading mode**:  
  - choose **None** for a plain background, or  
  - pick one of the light **paper backgrounds** for a notebook feel.

Optionally:

- **Paper background also in Live Preview**:  
  - ON if you want Reading and Writing to share the same paper;  
  - OFF if you prefer a clearer distinction between modes.

Remember: a small indicator in the upper‑right corner of each pane always shows whether it is ready for editing, whatever background you use.

## 7. Save as your “baseline”

Once you are happy with:

- the **Light** General palette,  
- the **Dark** palette behaviour,  
- the **Reading** and **Writing** text sizes,

you have a solid baseline setup.  

From here you can:

- explore the **[Reading mode](settings/reading-mode.md)** page for more refined typography;  
- tune **[Writing / Editing mode](settings/writing-mode.md)** if you spend many hours writing;  
- look at **[Usage examples](usage/journaling-setup.md)** for ready‑to‑import presets tailored to different workflows.

If anything looks strange or you want to reset, you can always restore the Default values in Style Settings for a given section and start again from this quick start.
