# Olivier’s Theme — Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for **Olivier’s Theme**, an advanced interface theme for Obsidian focused on legibility, typography and a calm, paper‑like writing environment.

If you spend a lot of time with your notes — thinking, writing, revising — this theme is designed to stay out of your way while keeping your vault beautiful and readable.

## What you will find here

- A **quick start** guide if you simply want a pleasant setup without touching every option.
- Detailed explanations of all **settings** exposed through the Style Settings plugin.
- A description of the **key ideas** behind the theme: cascading palettes, clear Editing indicators, active vs. background panels, consistent hover behavior, and typography tuned for reading and writing.
- Several **usage examples** (journaling, research, technical notes) with ready‑to‑import presets.
- A small **FAQ / troubleshooting** section for common questions.

## Recommended reading order

If you are new to the theme:

1. Start with **[Quick start](quick-start.md)**.  
2. Then skim through:
   - **[General settings](settings/general.md)**  
   - **[Light & Dark colors](settings/colors-light-dark.md)**  
3. When you begin to fine‑tune typography, read:
   - **[Reading mode](settings/reading-mode.md)**  
   - **[Writing / Editing mode](settings/writing-mode.md)**  

For more advanced customization:

- See **[Niceties & cssclasses](settings/niceties-cssclasses.md)** for per‑note refinements.
- Explore the **Usage** section for opinionated but practical presets.

## Requirements

To fully use the theme as described here, you will need:

- Obsidian with **Olivier’s Theme** installed and active.
